# Cantina Technical Exercise
## External Libraries
### JSON Simple
JSON Simple is used to parse JSON. It can be downloaded [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/downloads).
## Running
Run the CantinaMain.java file within the main package and provide the full path of the JSON file as a command line argument. 
Then, while the program is running, type any selector (such as "Input") and the program will find all 
instances of the selector and display the JSON objects it appears in.
## Testing
To test, simply run the CantinaTest.java file in the test module. Enter the full path of the JSON file when prompted 
and the test will complete.
